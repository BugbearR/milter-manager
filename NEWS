=== New applicable conditions

  * sendmail-compatible:
    It's a feature to avoid macro related incompatibility
    between Sendmail's milter implementation and Postfix's
    milter implementation.
    (ref. ((<Postfix before-queue Milter support -
    Workarounds|URL:http://www.postfix.org/MILTER_README.html#workarounds>)))

    It's not an applicable condition but it uses applicable
    condition framework to convert macros passed to a milter
    by MTA. dnsbl-milter can be worked with Postfix without
    a patch(*) by the feature.
