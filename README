== milter manager

milter manager is a milter to use multiple milters
effectively.

If milter manager is introduced, milter manager
administrates milters instead of MTA. The was has some
advantages:

  * reduce milter administration cost
  * combine milters flexibly

See ((<Introduction|"doc/introduction.rd">)) for more details.

== Dependencies

  * MTA that supports milter
    * Sendmail >= 8.13.8
    * Postfix >= 2.3.3
  * GLib >= 2.12.3
  * Ruby >= 1.8.5
  * Ruby/GLib2 (Ruby-GNOME2) >= 0.16.0
  * UN*X OS
    * Linux >= 2.6.18
    * FreeBSD

=== Optional dependencies

  * Cutter >= 1.0.6: unit testing framework for C

    It is needed for 'make check' and 'make coverage'.

    ((<Cutter|URL:http://cutter.sourceforge.net/>))

  * LCOV: graphical front-end for GCC's coverage testing tool gcov

    It is needed for 'make coverage'.

    ((<LCOV - the LTP GCOV extension|URL:http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php>))

== Get

tar.gz:
((<URL:http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=236233>))

Subversion:
  % svn co https://milter-manager.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/milter-manager/milter-manager/trunk milter-manager

== Install

See ((<Install|"doc/install.rd">)).

== Configuration

See ((<Configuration|"doc/configuration.rd">)).

== Usage

milter-manager command is installed into sbin/ not
bin/. In most cases, normal user doesn't include sbin/ in
PATH. You will need to use absolute path.

If you don't specify --prefix option for configure script,
milter-manager is installed into /usr/local/sbin/. You can
run milter-manager like the following:

  % /usr/local/sbin/milter-manager --help

Available options are shown if installation is succeeded.
Details of them are described in the next section. It's good
startup that we use --show-config option to confirm the
current configuration:

  % /usr/local/sbin/milter-manager --show-config

Command line options overrides configurations specified in
configuration file.

=== Options

: --help

   Shows available options and exits.

: --connection-spec=SPEC

   Specifies a socket that accepts connections from
   MTA. SPEC should be formatted as one of the followings:

     * unix:PATH
     * inet:PORT
     * inet:PORT@HOST
     * inet:PORT@[ADDRESS]
     * inet6:POST
     * inet6:PORT@HOST
     * inet6:PORT@[ADDRESS]

   Examples:
     * unix:/var/run/milter/milter-manager.sock
     * inet:10025
     * inet:10025@localhost
     * inet:10025@[127.0.0.1]
     * inet6:10025
     * inet6:10025@localhost
     * inet6:10025@[::1]

   This option overrides "manager.connection_spec" in
   configuration file.

: --config-dir=DIRECTORY

    Specifies a directory that includes milter-manager's
    configuration file. milter-manager tries to load
    DIRECTORY/milter-manager.conf. If it isn't find,
    milter-manager loads milter-manager.conf in default
    directory.

: --pid-file=FILE

   Saves process ID of milter-manager to FILE.

   This option overrides "manager.pid_file" in configuration
   file.

: --user-name=NAME

   Runs milter-manager as NAME user.
   milter-manager should be started by root.

   This option overrides "security.effective_user" in
   configuration file.

: --group-name=NAME

   Runs milter-manager as NAME group.
   milter-manager should be started by root.

   This option overrides "security.effective_group" in
   configuration file.

: --socket-group-name=NAME

   Changes group of UNIX domain socket for accepting
   connection by milter-manager to NAME group. Specified
   group should be one of the effective user's supplementary
   groups.

   This option overrides "manager.unix_socket_group" in
   configuration file.

: --daemon

   Runs milter-manager as daemon process.

   This option overrides "manager.daemon" in configuration
   file.

: --no-daemon

   This option cancels the prior --daemon option.

: --show-config

   Shows the current configuration and exits. The output
   format can be used in configuration file. This option is
   useful for confirming registered milters and reporting your
   milter-manager's configuration when you report
   milter-manager's problems.

: --verbose

   Logs verbosely. Logs by syslog with 'mail'. If
   milter-manager isn't daemon process, standard output is
   also used.

   'MILTER_LOG_LEVEL=all' environment variable configuration
   has the same effect.

: --version

   Shows version and exits.

== Tools

milter manager includes some useful tools. They are
installed into bin/.

  * ((<"doc/milter-test-server.rd">)): It talks MTA side
    milter protocol. It can be used for testing a milter
    without MTA.
  * ((<"doc/milter-test-client.rd">)): It is a milter that
    just shows received data from MTA. It can be used for
    confirming what data is sent from MTA.
  * milter-performance-check: It is a SMTP client that
    measures MTA performance.
  * milter-manager-log-analyzer: It analyzes log of
    milter-manager and visualizes behavior of milters
    registered to milter-manager.

=== milter-performance-check

milter-performance-check is a SMTP client that measures MTA
performance. milter-test-server measures milter's
performance and miter-performance-check measures MTA +
milter's performance.

smtp-source bundled with Postfix is a similar
tool. smtp-source has more features.

milter-performance-check is useful because it measures
elapsed time of only SMTP sessions. smtp-source doesn't
provide the feature. You need to also use 'time' command and
measure smtp-source command runtime not elapsed time of SMTP
sessions.

Normally, there isn't big difference between elapsed time of
SMTP sessions and tool runtime.

If you satisfy milter-performance-check's features, it's
better that you use milter-performance-check. If you don't,
smtp-source is more better tool for you.

==== Options

: --help

   Shows available options and exits.

: --smtp-server=SERVER

   Uses SEVER as target SMTP server.

   The default is localhost.

: --smtp-port=PORT

   Uses PORT as SMTP port.

: --helo-fqdn=FQDN

   Uses FQDN as HELO SMTP command.

   The default localhost.localdomain.

: --from=FROM

   Uses FROM as MAIL SMTP command.

   The default from@example.com.

: --force-from=FROM

   Uses FROM as MAIL SMTP command even if mail file includes
   'From:' header.

   The default is none.

: --recipient=RECIPIENT

   Uses RECIPIENT as RCPT SMTP command. If you want to use
   multiple recipients, use --recipient n-times.

   The default is [to@example.com].

: --force-recipient=RECIPIENT

   includes 'To:' header. If you want to use multiple
   recipients, use --recipient n-times.

   The default is none.

: --n-mails=N

   Sends N mails. All mails are sent concurrently.

   The default is 100.

: --period=PERIOD

   Sends mails in PERIOD seconds/minutes/hours. Each mail is
   sent averagely. PERIOD is treated as seconds when its
   unit is omitted.

   Example (100 mails are sent):
     * --period=5    # sends mails at intervals of 0.05 seconds (5 / 100)
     * --period=50s  # sends mails at intervals of 0.5 seconds (50 / 100)
     * --period=10m  # sends mails at intervals of 6 seconds (60 * 10 / 100)
     * --period=0.5h # sends mails at intervals of 18 seconds (60 * 60 * 0.5 / 100)

   The default is none.

: --interval=INTERVAL

   Sends mails at intervals of INTERVAL seconds/minutes/hours.
   INTERVAL is treated as seconds when its unit is omitted.

   Example:

     * --interval=0.5s # sends mails at intervals of 0.5 seconds
     * --interval=10m  # sends mails at intervals of 10 minutes
     * --interval=0.5h # sends mails at intervals of 0.5 hours

   The default is none.

: --shuffle, --no-shuffle

   Shuffles target mails before sending.

   The default is false. (don't shuffle.)

=== milter-manager-log-analyzer

milter-manager-log-analyzer analyzes milter-manager log and
generates graphs for milters' result. It's useful for
confirming system status transition because graphs shows
data in time-line. Graphs can also be used for comparing
changes between before introducing new milter and after
introducing new milter.

==== Options

: --help

   Shows available options and exits.

: --log=lOG_FILE

   Reads log from LOG_FILE

   The default is standard input.

   Outputs graphs, HTML and data to DIRECTORY.

   The default is the current directory. (".")

: --no-update-db

   Doesn't update database. It's useful for just generates
   graphs.

   If this option is not specified, database will be updated.
